Programming language:Java 
 
I implemented interactive mode and updated Ai player with depth value using A* algorithm.

This program contains Classes:
AiPlayer.java   
GameBoard.java   
maxconnect4.java 
Node.java      
 Upload all the classes in the omega  .
after the upload is done run the maxconnect4.java


Instructions to run the code:
Once the files (AiPlayer.java,GameBoard.java, maxconnect4.java, node.java) have been added to Omega machine, compile the code by running javac maxconnect4.java.
or the code can be run on the terminal with the an installed jdk.


Having successfully compiled the code, run the following code to calculate ONE MOVE MODE
and the program simply makes a single move and terminates. In particular, the program will :
Read the input file and initialize the board state and current score, as in interactive mode.
Print the current board state and score. If the board is full, exit.
Choose and make the next move.
Print the current board state and score.
Save the current board state to the output file IN EXACTLY THE SAME FORMAT THAT IS USED FOR INPUT FILES.
Exit
